    {\em Software Engineer (San Francisco, CA)}
    \begin{suber}
	\item Did something.
    \end{suber}
    \item {\bf Adobe AIR Team (2008-2011) and Flash Runtime Mobile Team (2011-2012)}\\
    {\em Software Engineer (San Francisco, CA)}
    \begin{suber}
	\item Implemented features and fixed over 1,000 bugs through 15 releases of Adobe AIR (Flash for stand-alone apps) in areas including rendering, video, and OS interaction 
	\item Developed across  Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac on a fifteen-year-old codebase with tens of thousands of files written in C, C++, Objective C, Java, Actionscript, and Assembly
	\item ``Module Owner'' of the AIR SDK and Installer since 2010, responsible for reviewing every line of code going into those projects with dozens of reviews completed and hundreds of defects logged
	\item Led a team of 5 developers and QA to implement the ``Captive Runtime'' feature on Mac and Windows 
		\begin{suberb}
			\item Previously AIR apps depended on a single centrally located copy of the AIR Runtime. Developers were demanding the option to embed the runtime in their apps to remove this dependency
			\item Designed this major new distribution option from the conceptual phase, including a detailed roadmap with all the steps needed to get captive runtime apps into the Mac App Store 
			\item Worked with legal and upper management to communicate with Apple regarding this sensitive issue.
			\item Coordinated heavily with product management to get both features into the release schedule during a time of upheaval. As a result the captive runtime feature was done months before anything else
			\item Provided support on the roadmap after being moved to the mobile team. The first AIR app was recently accepted into the Mac App Store as per the plan
			\item Implemented the feature on Android, including some major rearchitecting of the runtime
			\item The feature was highlighted in the main keynote at the 2011 Adobe MAX conference
		\end{suberb}
	\item Responsible for the AIR Developer Tool (ADT), a Java codebase for packaging AIR applications
		\begin{suberb}
			\item Managed it as it grew in scope and size 300\% to handle more platforms and features 
			\item Maintained backwards compatibility, architecture, and the contributions of multiple teams
		\end{suberb}
	\item Took over the AIR desktop installer, a custom-built multi-platform installation platform for AIR apps
		\begin{suberb}
			\item Vastly improved the installer logging and reporting process as well as overall reliability
			\item Handled troubleshooting requests from forums and customers, including CS5.5 ship stoppers
		\end{suberb}
	\item Led a team of 6 developers and QA to implement ``Native App Installers'' on iOS, Windows, and Mac
		\begin{suberb}
			\item Originally AIR apps were distributed via a cross platform zip format. This had many limitations, especially on mobile, so developers needed the option to package to native installer formats
			\item Coordinated with a team in India working on native installers for Android, Debian, and Red Hat
			\item Reverse engineered the .ipa format to let AIR apps be submitted undetected to the iOS App Store
		\end{suberb}
	\item Owned the Android compatibility layer and Android .apk packaging after joining the mobile team
	\item Helped port the Android Flash Player to Honeycomb and Ice Cream Sandwich

        \begin{suberb}
        	\item Hired and Managed a team of 11 TAs for a class of 70
		\item Coordinated project redesigns, assignment grading, office hours, and preparations for classes
